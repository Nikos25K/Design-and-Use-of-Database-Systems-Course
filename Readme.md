# Database Design and Management Course Project

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the project work for the Database Design and Management course at Department of Informatics & Telecommunications - NKUA. <br>
The project is divided into two main assignments related to designing and querying a database for a game concept called "Movie Star."

### Exercise 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram Design

In this exercise, an ER diagram is created to model the structure of the "Movie Star" game database. Players assume the role of a director, managing movies, actors, genres, and other elements. The task involves designing a database structure that supports various game functionalities, including film creation, social media interactions, and competition between players based on social engagement metrics.

**Deliverables:**
- MySQL Workbench ER diagram (.mwb file)
- SQL schema definition file (.sql file)
- Readme.txt file explaining design choices and assumptions


### Exercise 2: SQL Query Writing

**Description:**
This exercise focuses on implementing complex SQL queries on a pre-existing database structure for the "Movie Star" game. <br>
The task is to write SQL queries to retrieve information about movies, actors, directors, and genres, adhering to specific criteria.

**Deliverables:**
- Single SQL file (ask2.sql) containing all queries, preceded by comments indicating each question's number and relevant team member information

### Exercise 3: Web Based API using MySQL

**Description:**
This exercise focuses on implementing certain functions that will access the database and return certain results.<br>
This assignment uses bottle and pymysql in order to create a web based environment and make more complex queries that will return the results in a way that can be displayed on-screen.

**Deliverables:**
- Python file (app.py) containing the implementation of the functions that access the database and return the results.
